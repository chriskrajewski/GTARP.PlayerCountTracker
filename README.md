## How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/pnpm
- Supabase account for database
- Twitch API credentials (for streamer data)
- GitHub token (optional, for changelog features)

### Setup

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Create your Supabase schema using the SQL in `api2db/sql/sqlSetup.sql`
   - Set up notification banner tables using `api2db/sql/notification_banners_schema.sql`
   - Configure Supabase Edge Functions to ingest data on a schedule using `api2db/edgeFunction`

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the required values:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
     SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
     SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-service-role-key
     TWITCH_CLIENT=your-twitch-client-id
     TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-twitch-client-secret
     GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=your-github-username
     GITHUB_REPO_NAME=your-repo-name
     GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token
     ```

3. **Development**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   or with Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   vercel dev
   ```

4. **Production Build**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## Security Considerations for Production

This application includes several security measures for production deployment:

1. **Content Security Policy**: Restricts resource loading to trusted sources
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API abuse and brute force attacks
3. **Secure Headers**: Protection against XSS, clickjacking, and other common attacks
4. **Anonymized Data**: GitHub commit data is anonymized for changelog display
5. **Error Handling**: Safe error responses that don't leak sensitive information
6. **Input Validation**: All user inputs and API responses are validated

### Additional Deployment Recommendations

1. Set up proper monitoring and logging
2. Regularly update dependencies
3. Configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
4. Implement DDoS protection (Cloudflare or similar)
5. Use environment-specific configurations
